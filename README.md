# LearnX

Personalised insights for better learning

# Overview

LearnX is an AI-powered educational platform designed to identify concept-level learning gaps in students by analysing quiz responses.
Instead of focusing only on scores, LearnX emphasises concept mastery, personalised feedback, and data-driven teaching support to promote inclusive and effective learning.

# Problem Statement

Traditional evaluation systems provide marks but fail to reveal why a student performed poorly. Teachers cannot personalise feedback for every student, especially in large classrooms, leading to undetected learning gaps and increased educational inequality.

# Solution

LearnX analyses student quiz responses and maps mistakes to specific learning concepts. Using AI-powered analysis with the Gemini API, the platform generates personalised feedback for students, enabling early and targeted academic intervention.

# Key Features

1. Interactive quiz interface with concept-mapped questions
2. AI-based learning gap detection at the concept level
3. Personalised feedback generated using the Gemini API
4. Focused improvement recommendations for students
6. Concept-wise progress visualisation
7. Inclusive and scalable design suitable for low-resource environments
